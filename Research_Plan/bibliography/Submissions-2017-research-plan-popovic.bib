abstract = {In this paper we present results from the first application of robust geostatistical modeling techniques to radio environment and coverage mapping of wireless networks. We perform our analysis of these methods with a case study mapping the coverage of a 2.5 GHz WiMax network at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Drawing from our experiences, we propose several new methods and extensions to basic geostatistical theory that are necessary for use in a radio mapping application. We also derive a set of best practices and discuss potential areas of future work. We find that this approach to radio environment mapping is feasible and produces maps that are more accurate and informative than both explicitly tuned path loss models and basic data fitting approaches.},

Today's robots are already exploring our deep oceans, tracking harmful algal blooms and pollution spread, monitoring climate variables, and even studying remote volcanoes. This article collates and discusses the significant advancements and applications of marine, terrestrial, and airborne robotic systems developed for environmental monitoring during the last two decades. Emerging research trends for achieving large-scale environmental monitoring are also reviewed, including cooperative robotic teams, robot and wireless sensor network (WSN) interaction, adaptive sampling and model-aided path planning.

Based on a probabilistic volumetric map that is built in real time, the robot can quantify the expected information gain from a set of discrete candidate views. We propose and evaluate several formulations to quantify this information gain for the volumetric reconstruction task, including visibility likelihood and the likelihood of seeing new parts of the object. These metrics are combined with the cost of robot movement in utility functions. The next best view is selected by optimizing these functions, aiming to maximize the likelihood of discovering new parts of the object. We evaluate the functions with simulated and real world experiments within a modular software system that is adaptable to other robotic platforms and reconstruction problems. We release our implementation open source.},

@article{Hitz2015,
abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots are increasingly employed to take measurements for environ- mental monitoring, but planning informative, measurement-rich paths through large three- dimensional (3D) environments is still challenging. The problem of planning such paths is known as the informative path planning (IPP) problem, and has been shown to be non- deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard. Existing algorithms focus on providing guaran- tees on suboptimal solutions, but do not scale well to large problem instances. In this paper, we introduce a novel IPP algorithm that uses an evolutionary strategy (ES) technique to optimize a parametrized path in continuous space, which is subject to various constraints regarding path budgets and motion capabilities of an autonomous mobile robot. Moreover, we introduce a replanning scheme to adapt the planned paths according to information gained from measurements taken in situ during a data collection mission. When compared to opti- mal paths on discrete graphs, our method provides competitive results at significantly lower computation times and memory requirements. Our results show that planning in continuous space can provide solutions which outperform the optimum on a discrete graph. The proposed replanning scheme enables to build models with up to 25{\{}{\%}{\}} lower uncertainty within an (initially unknown) areas of interest. After presenting theoretical results, we tailored the proposed algorithms for data collection using an autonomous surface vessel (ASV) within the context of an ecological study, during which the method was validated through three field deployments on Lake Zurich, Switzerland. Spatiotemporal variations are shown over a period of three months and an area of 350 m × 350 m × 13 m. Whereas our theoretical solution can be applied to multiple applications, our field results specifically highlight the effectiveness of our planner for monitoring toxic cyanobacteria populations in a pre-alpine lake, and for identifying hot-spots within the cyanobacterial distribution.},

abstract = {Seed dispersal, interacting with environmental disturbance and management across heterogeneous landscapes, results in irregular weed spatial distributions. Describing, predicting, and managing weed populations requires an understanding of how weeds are distributed spatially and the consequences of this distribution for population processes. Semivariograms and kriged maps of weed populations in several fields have helped describe spatial structure, but few generalizations can be drawn except that populations are aggregated at one or more scales. Limited information is available on the effect of weed arrangement, pattern, or field location on weed population processes. Because weeds are neither regular nor uniform in distribution, mean density alone is of limited value in estimating yield loss or describing population dynamics over a whole field. Sampling strategies that account for spatial distribution can increase sampling efficiency. Further research should focus on understanding processes that cause changes in spatial distributions over time to help predict rates of invasion and potential extent of colonization.},

abstract = {Active SLAM is the task of actively planning robot paths while simultaneously building a map and localizing within. It is challenging in that the feasibility of paths will depend on future observations along the path, and the complexity of the problem grows quickly with the size of the map and the length of robot trajectory. This work proposes a Topological Feature Graph (TFG) representation of the map that scales well and develops an active SLAM algorithm with it. The TFG enables a unified quantification of exploration and exploitation gains with a single entropy metric and hence facilitates a natural and principled balance between map exploration and refinement. A probabilistic roadmap path-planner is used to generate robot paths in real time. Results from hardware experiment show that the proposed approach achieves better accuracy than the traditional grid-map based approaches while requiring orders of magnitude less computation and memory resources.},

We formalize this task as a classification problem with sequential measurements, where the unknown function is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We propose LSE, an algorithm that guides both sampling and classification based on GP-derived confidence bounds, and provide theoretical guarantees about its sample complexity. Furthermore, we extend LSE and its theory to two more natural settings: (1) where the threshold level is implicitly defined as a percentage of the (unknown) maximum of the target function and (2) where samples are selected in batches. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods on two problems of practical interest, namely autonomous monitoring of algal populations in a lake environment and geolocating network latency.},

We assume each robot has to autonomously navigate to a pre-specified set of goals in unknown environments and develop an approach that enables the robots to collaborate in order to reduce the uncertainty in their state estimation. We formulate this problem as multi-robot belief space planning, where the belief represents the probability distribution of robot states from the entire group, as well as the mapped environment thus far. Our approach is capable of guiding each robot to reduce its uncertainty by re-observing areas previously observed (only) by other robots. Direct observations between robot states, such as relative-pose measurements, are not required, providing enhanced flexibility for the group as the robots do not have to coordinate rendezvous with each other. Instead, our framework supports indirect constraints between the robots, that are induced by mutual observations of the same area possibly at different time instances, and accounts for these future multi-robot constraints within the planning phase. The proposed approach is evaluated in a simulation study.},

The system filters, transforms, and analyzes the cluttered range data in real-time to determine the distance to the ground and to the top of the crops. We assess the system in an indoor testbed and in a corn field.

abstract = {We propose information-theoretic strategies for Occupancy Grid (OG) compression to enable high-speed ex- ploration on computationally constrained mobile robots. We first formulate optimal lossy compression for OGs based on the Principle of Relevant Information. The solution to this formulation is a simple compression algorithm that is motivated by rate distortion theory. We then compress OGs to differ- ent resolutions and develop a second optimization based on the Information Bottleneck method that chooses a resolution simultaneously maximizing compression and minimizing loss of information from the robot's sensor measurements. On computationally constrained systems, the resulting reduction in computational complexity enables planning over longer predictive horizons, leading to higher-speed operation. Using these techniques to adaptively optimize OG resolution as the robot enters a new area causes it to autonomously slow down in obstacle-dense locations and speed up in open expanses. We simulate and experimentally evaluate mutual information- based exploration through cluttered indoor environments with exploration rates that adapt based on environment complexity, leading to an order-of-magnitude increase in the maximum rate of exploration in contrast to non-adaptive techniques given the same finite computational resources.},

@article{Krause2008,
abstract = {When monitoring spatial phenomena, which can often be modeled as Gaussian processes (GPs), choosing sensor locations is a fundamental task. There are several common strategies to address this task, for example, geometry or disk models, placing sensors at the points of highest entropy (vari-ance) in the GP model, and A-, D-, or E-optimal design. In this paper, we tackle the combinatorial optimization problem of maximizing the mutual information between the chosen locations and the locations which are not selected. We prove that the problem of finding the configuration that max-imizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1 − 1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of mutual information. We also show how submodularity can be used to obtain online bounds, and design branch and bound search procedures. We then extend our algorithm to exploit lazy evaluations and local structure in the GP, yielding significant speedups. We also extend our approach to find placements which are robust against node failures and uncertainties in the model. These extensions are again associated with rigorous theoretical approximation guarantees, exploiting the submodu-larity of the objective function. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach towards optimizing mutual information in a very extensive empirical study on two real-world data sets.},

abstract = {This article explores the potential use of multi-spectral high-spatial resolution QuickBird imagery to detect cruciferous weed patches in winter wheat fields. In the present study, research was conducted on six individual naturally infested fields (field-scale study: field area ranging between 3 and 52 ha) and on a QuickBird-segmented winter wheat image (broad-scale study: area covering approximately 263 winter wheat fields, approxi- mately 2 656 ha) located in the province of Co ́ rdoba (southern Spain). To evaluate the feasibility of mapping cruciferous weed patches in both the field-scale and broad-scale studies, two supervised classification methods were used: the Maximum likelihood clas- sifier (MLC) and vegetation indices. Then, the best classification methods were selected to develop in-season site-specific cruciferous weed patch treatment maps. The analysis showed that cruciferous weed patches were accurately discriminated in both field-scale and broad-scale scenarios. Thus, considering the broad-scale study, classification accuracies of 91.3 and 89.45 {\%} were obtained using the MLC and blue/green (B/G) vegetation indices, respectively. The site-specific treatment maps obtained from the best classifiers indicated that there is a great potential for reducing herbicide use through in-season, cruciferous weed patch site-specific control on both a field-scale and broad-scale. For example, it can be determined that by applying site-specific treatment maps on a broad-scale, herbicide savings of 61.31 {\%} for the no-treatment areas and 13.02 {\%} for the low-dose herbicide areas were obtained.},

We extend the existing work on polynomial trajec- tory generation by presenting a method of jointly optimizing polynomial path seg- ments in an unconstrained quadratic program that is numerically stable for high- order polynomials and large numbers of segments, and is easily formulated for ef- ficient sparse computation.We also present a technique for automatically selecting the amount of time allocated to each segment, and hence the quadrotor speeds along the path, as a function of a single parameter determining aggressiveness, subject to actuator constraints. The use of polynomial trajectories, coupled with the differen- tially flat representation of the quadrotor, eliminates the need for computationally intensive sampling and simulation in the high dimensional state space of the vehi- cle during motion planning. Our approach generates high-quality trajectories much faster than purely sampling-based optimal kinodynamic planning methods, but sac- rifices the guarantee of asymptotic convergence to the global optimum that those methods provide. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by efficiently generating trajectories through challenging indoor spaces and successfully travers- ing them at speeds up to 8 m/s.

abstract = {We develop a computationally efficient control policy for active perception that incorporates explicit models of sensing and mobility to build 3D maps for ground and aerial robots. Like previous work, our policy maximizes an information-theoretic objective function between the discrete occupancy belief distribution (e.g., voxel grid) and future measurements that can be made by mobile sensors. However, our work is unique in three ways. First, we show that by using Cauchy-Schwarz Quadratic Mutual Information (CSQMI), we get significant gains in efficiency. Second, while most previous methods adopt a myopic, gradient-following approach that yields poor convergence properties, our algorithm searches over a set of paths and is less susceptible to local minima. In doing so, we explicitly incorporate models of sensors, and model the dependence (and independence) of measurements over multiple time steps in a path. Third, because we consider models of sensing and mobility, our method naturally applies to both ground and aerial vehicles. The paper describes the basic models, the problem formulation and the algorithm, and demonstrates applications via simulation and experimentation.},

abstract = {This work investigates the problem of planning under uncertainty, with application to mobile robotics. We propose a probabilistic framework in which the robot bases its decisions on the generalized belief, which is a probabilistic description of its own state and of external variables of interest. The approach naturally leads to a dual-layer architecture: an inner estimation layer, which performs inference to predict the outcome of possible decisions, and an outer decisional layer which is in charge of deciding the best action to undertake. The approach does not discretize the state or control space, and allows planning in continuous domain. Moreover, it allows to relax the assumption of maximum likelihood observations: predicted measurements are treated as random variables and are not considered as given. Experimental results show that our planning approach produces smooth trajectories while maintaining uncertainty within reasonable bounds.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel and computa- tionally efficient algorithm for simultaneous exploration and coverage with a vision-guided micro aerial vehicle (MAV) in unknown environments. This algorithm continually plans a path that allows the MAV to fulfil two objectives at the same time while avoiding obstacles: observe as much unexplored space as possible, and observe as much of the surface of the environment as possible given viewing angle and distance constraints. The former and latter objectives are known as the exploration and coverage problems respectively. Our algorithm is particularly useful for automated 3D reconstruction at the street level and in indoor environments where obstacles are omnipresent. By solving the exploration problem, we maximize the size of the reconstructed model. By solving the coverage problem, we ma imize the completeness of the model. Our algorithm leverages the state lattice concept such that the planned path adheres to specified motion constraints. Furthermore, our algorithm is computationally efficient and able to run on-board the MAV in real-time. We assume that the MAV is equipped with a forward- looking depth-sensing camera in the form of either a stereo camera or RGB-D camera. We use simulation experiments to validate our algorithm. In addition, we show that our algorithm achieves a significantly higher level of coverage as compared to an exploration-only approach while still allowing the MAV to fully explore the environment.},

Only the first edge of this branch is executed at every planning step, while repetition of this procedure leads to complete exploration results. The proposed planner is capable of running online, onboard a robot with limited resources.

In general, the accuracy of the mapping process depends directly on the accuracy of the localization process. This paper address the problem of maximizing the accuracy of the map building process during exploration by adaptively selecting control actions that maximize localisation accuracy. The map building and exploration task is modeled using an Occupancy Grid (OG) with concurrent localisation performed using a feature-based Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm. Adaptive sensing aims at maximizing the map information by simultaneously maximizing the expected Shannon information gain (Mutual Information) on the OG map and minimizing the uncertainty of the vehicle pose and map feature uncertainty in the SLAM process. The resulting map building system is demonstrated in an indoor environment using data from a laser scanner mounted on a mobile platform.},

A wide variety of covariance (kernel) functions are presented and their properties discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a Bayesian and a classical perspective. Many connections to other well-known techniques from machine learning and statistics are discussed, including support-vector machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevance vector machines and others. Theoretical issues including learning curves and the PAC-Bayesian framework are treated, and several approximation methods for learning with large datasets are discussed. The book contains illustrative examples and exercises, and code and datasets are available on the Web. Appendixes provide mathematical background and a discussion of Gaussian Markov processes.},

abstract = {Autonomous micro helicopters are about to play a major role in tasks like search and rescue, environment monitoring, security surveillance, inspection, etc. If they are further realized in small scale, they can also be used in narrow outdoor and indoor environments and represent only a limited risk for people. However, for such operations, navigating based on GPS information only is not sufficient. Fully autonomous operation in cities or other dense environments requires micro helicopters to fly at low altitudes---where GPS signals are often shadowed---or indoors, and to actively explore unknown environments while avoiding collisions and creating maps. This involves a number of challenges on all levels of helicopter design, perception, actuation, control, and navigation, which still have to be solved. The SFLY project was an EU-funded project with the goal to create a swarm of vision-controlled micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) capable of autonomous navigation, 3D mapping, and optimal surveillance coverage in GPS-denied environments. The SFLY MAVs do not rely on remote control, radio beacons, or motion-capture systems but can fly all by themselves using only a single onboard camera and an IMU. This paper describes the technical challenges that have been faced and the results achieved, from hardware design and embedded programming to vision-based navigation and mapping, with an overview of how all the modules work and how they have been integrated into the final system. Code, datasets, and videos are publicly available to the Robotics community. Experimental results demonstrating three MAVs navigating autonomously in an unknown GPS-denied environment and performing 3D mapping and optimal surveillance coverage are presented.},

The occupancy grid is a multidimensional random field that maintains stochastic estimates of the occupancy state of the cells in a spatial lattice. To construct a sensor-derived map of the robot's world, the cell state estimates are obtained by interpreting the incoming range readings using probabilistic sensor models. Bayesian estimation procedures allow the incremental updating of the occupancy grid, using readings taken from several sensors over multiple points of view. The use of occupancy grids from mapping and for navigation is examined. Operations on occupancy grids and extensions of the occupancy grid framework are briefly considered},

In- spired by prior work, we accomplish this task by formulating an information-theoretic objective function based on Cauchy- Schwarz quadratic mutual information (CSQMI) that guides robots to obtain measurements in uncertain regions of the map. We then contribute a two stage approach for active mapping. First, we generate a candidate set of trajectories using a combination of global planning and generation of local motion primitives. From this set, we choose a trajectory that maximizes the information-theoretic objective. Second, we employ a gradient- based trajectory optimization technique to locally refine the chosen trajectory such that the CSQMI objective is maximized while satisfying the robot's motion constraints. We evaluated our approach through a series of simulations and experiments on a ground robot and an aerial robot mapping unknown 3D environments. Real-world experiments suggest our approach reduces the time to explore an environment by 70{\{}{\%}{\}} compared to a closest frontier exploration strategy and 57{\{}{\%}{\}} compared to an information-based strategy that uses global planning, while simulations demonstrate the approach extends to aerial robots with higher-dimensional state.},

abstract = {Increasingly, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) are changing the way that scientists and practitioners collect environmental data. Current UASs, however, are largely relegated to collecting data while flying remotely, far away in the air. This article examines two case studies where micro-UASs fly in immediate proximity to the environment, enabling them to collect physical samples and capture sensor data that cannot be obtained at a distance. The first case study presents an aerial water sampler that flies to remote locations and dips a pump into the water to collect samples for lab analysis. The second case study examines a UAS that flies within a meter of crops to accurately measure their height. Each requires different sensors and methods specifically tailored to operating and interacting near the environment. This article evaluates the performance of these systems and also presents preliminary validation that they collect datasets that are compatible with those gathered by existing approaches. Futhermore, it distills some common underlying design and operating principles shared by UASs aimed at working close to the environment. Finally, this article concludes that in spite of numerous pending challenges, UASs that directly interact with the environment will transform the way environmental data is collected.},

abstract = {This paper reports on an integrated navigation algorithm for the visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) robotic area coverage problem. In the robotic area coverage problem, the goal is to explore and map a given target area within a reasonable amount of time. This goal necessitates the use of minimally redundant overlap trajectories for coverage efficiency; however, visual SLAM's navigation estimate will inevitably drift over time in the absence of loop closures. Therefore, efficient area coverage and good SLAM navigation performance represent competing objectives. To solve this decision-making problem, we introduce perception-driven navigation, an integrated navigation algorithm that automatically balances between exploration and revisitation using a reward framework. This framework accounts for SLAM localization uncertainty, area coverage performance, and the identification of good candidate regions in the environment for visual perception. Results are shown for both a hybrid simulation and real-world demonstration of a visual SLAM system for autonomous underwater ship hull inspection.},

In this setting, the robot must trade-off between exploring new area to complete the task and exploiting the existing information to maintain good localization. Selecting actions that decrease the map uncertainty while not significantly increasing the robot's localization uncertainty is challenging. We present a novel information-theoretic utility function that uses both Shannon's and Renyi's definitions of entropy to jointly consider the uncertainty of the robot and the map. This allows us to fuse both uncertainties without the use of manual tuning. We present simulations and experiments comparing the proposed utility function to state-of-the-art utility functions, which only use Shannon's entropy.

abstract = {The use of remote imagery captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has tremendous potential for designing detailed site-specific weed control treatments in early post-emergence, which have not possible previously with conventional airborne or satellite images. A robust and entirely automatic object-based image analysis (OBIA) procedure was developed on a series of UAV images using a six-band multispectral camera (visible and near-infrared range) with the ultimate objective of generating a weed map in an experimental maize field in Spain. The OBIA procedure combines several contextual, hierarchical and object-based features and consists of three consecutive phases: 1) classification of crop rows by application of a dynamic and auto-adaptive classification approach, 2) discrimination of crops and weeds on the basis of their relative positions with reference to the crop rows, and 3) generation of a weed infestation map in a grid structure. The estimation of weed coverage from the image analysis yielded satisfactory results. The relationship of estimated versus observed weed densities had a coefficient of determination of r(2)=0.89 and a root mean square error of 0.02. A map of three categories of weed coverage was produced with 86{\%} of overall accuracy. In the experimental field, the area free of weeds was 23{\%}, and the area with low weed coverage ({\textless}5{\%} weeds) was 47{\%}, which indicated a high potential for reducing herbicide application or other weed operations. The OBIA procedure computes multiple data and statistics derived from the classification outputs, which permits calculation of herbicide requirements and estimation of the overall cost of weed management operations in advance.},

The problem of mapping is addressed as a classification task where the robot's environment is classified into regions of occupancy and free space. This is obtained by employing a modified Gaussian process as a non-parametric Bayesian learning technique to exploit the fact that real- world environments inherently possess structure. This structure introduces dependencies between points on the map which are not accounted for by many common mapping techniques such as occupancy grids. Our approach is an ‘anytime' algorithm that is capable of generating accurate representations of large environments at arbitrary resolutions to suit many applications. It also provides inferences with associated variances into occluded regions and between sensor beams, even with relatively few observations. Crucially, the technique can handle noisy data, potentially from multiple sources, and fuse it into a robust common probabilistic representation of the robot's surroundings. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on simulated datasets with known ground truth and in outdoor urban environments.},

A common approach in machine learning to model spatial dynamics is to use the nonparametric Bayesian framework known as Gaussian Processes (GPs) (c.f., [1]) which are fully specified by a mean and a covariance function. However, defining suitable covariance functions that are able to appropriately model complex space-time dependencies in the environment is a challenging task. In this paper, we develop a generic approach for constructing several classes of covariance functions for spatio-temporal GP modeling. The GP models are then extended to perform efficient path planning in continuous space while maximizing the information gain. Extensive empirical evaluation for the different classes of covariance functions using real world sensing datasets is discussed, including experiments on a tethered robotic system - Networked Info Mechanical System (NIMS).},

abstract = {Beavers are often described as ecological engineers with an ability to modify the structure and flow of fluvial systems and create complex wetland environments with dams, ponds, and canals. Consequently, beaver activity has implications for a wide range of environmental ecosystem services including biodiversity, flood risk mitigation, water quality, and sustainable drinking water provision. With the current debate surrounding the reintroduction of beavers into the United Kingdom, it is critical to be able to monitor the impact of beavers upon the environment. This study presents the first proof of concept results showing how a lightweight hexacopter fitted with a simple digital camera can be used to derive orthophoto and digital surface model (DSM) data products at a site where beavers have recently been reintroduced. Early results indicate that analysis of the fine-scale (0.01 m) orthophoto and DSM can be used to identify impacts on the ecosystem structure including the extent of dams and associated pond...},

@article{Hollinger2009,
abstract = {This paper examines the problem of locating a mobile, non-adversarial target in an indoor environment using multiple robotic searchers. One way to formulate this problem is to assume a known environment and choose searcher paths most likely to intersect with the path taken by the target. We refer to this as the multi-robot efficient search path planning (MESPP) problem. Such path planning problems are NP-hard, and optimal solutions typically scale exponentially in the number of searchers. We present an approximation algorithm that utilizes finite-horizon planning and implicit coordination to achieve linear scalability in the number of searchers. We prove that solving the MESPP problem requires maximizing a non-decreasing, submodular objective function, which leads to theoretical bounds on the performance of our approximation algorithm. We extend our analysis by considering the scenario where searchers are given noisy non-line-of-sight ranging measurements to the target. For this scenario, we derive and integrate online Bayesian measurement updating into our framework. We demonstrate the performance of our framework in two large-scale simulated environments, and we further validate our results using data from a novel ultra-wideband ranging sensor. Finally, we provide an analysis that demonstrates the relationship between MESPP and the intuitive average capture time metric. Results show that our proposed linearly scalable approximation algorithm generates searcher paths that are competitive with those generated by exponential algorithms.},

The existing methods for coverage path planning consider a uniformly interesting target area and hence all the regions are covered with high resolution. However in many real world applications items of interest are not uniformly distributed but form patches of locally high interest. Therefore, with sparse sampling of uninteresting sections of the environment and high resolution sampling of interesting patches, the trajectory of the robot can become shorter. In this paper, we present a novel coverage strategy based on Space-Filling Curves that can accomplish non-uniform coverage of regions in the target area. Simulations and real robot experiments indicate that with the new strategy, travel time / cost of the task can be (almost) always less than a regular `lawnmower' coverage pattern.},

A key challenge is how to compute a continuous path over space and time that will allow a robot to best sample the environment for an initially unknown phenomenon. To address this problem we devise a layered Bayesian Optimisation approach that uses two Gaussian Processes, one to model the phenomenon and the other to model the quality of selected paths. By using different acquisition functions over both models we tackle the exploration-exploitation trade off in a principled manner. Our method optimises sampling over continuous paths and allows us to find trajectories that maximise the reward over the path. We test our method on a large scale experiment for modelling ozone concentration in the US, and on a mobile robot modelling the changes in luminosity. Comparisons are presented against information based criteria and point-based strategies demonstrating the benefits of our method.},

The work is motivated by planning domains involving nontrivial dynamics, spatially varying measurement properties, and obstacle constraints. To make the problem tractable, we restrict the motion plan to a nominal trajectory stabilized with a linear estimator and controller. This allows us to predict distributions over future states given a candidate nominal trajectory. Using these distributions to ensure a bounded probability of collision, the algorithm incrementally constructs a graph of trajectories through state space, while efficiently searching over candidate paths through the graph at each iteration. This process results in a search tree in belief space that provably converges to the optimal path. We analyze the algorithm theoretically and also provide simulation results demonstrating its utility for balancing information gathering to reduce uncertainty and finding low cost paths.},

Distance from canopy sensing capabilities are sensor-specific, which needs to be taken into account when implementing such a system.

In this article, we describe algorithms which efficiently find provably near-optimal solutions to large, complex information gathering problems. Our algorithms exploit submodularity, an intuitive notion of diminishing returns common tomany sensing problems: themore sensors we have already deployed, the less we learn by placing another sensor. In addition to identifying the most informative sensing locations, our algorithms can handle more challenging settings, where sensors need to be able to reliably communicate over lossy links, where mobile robots are used for collecting data, or where solutions need to be robust against adversaries and sensor failures. We also present results applying our algorithms to several real-world sensing tasks, including environmental monitoring using robotic sensors, activity recognition using a built sensing chair, a sensor placement challenge, and deciding which blogs to read on the Web.},

We introduce Interleaved Optimization with Sampling-based Motion Planning (IOS-MP), a new method that effectively combines global exploration and local optimization to quickly compute high quality motion plans. Our approach combines two paradigms: (1) asymptotically-optimal sampling-based motion planning, which is highly effective at global exploration but relatively slow at locally refining paths, and (2) optimization-based motion planning, which locally optimizes paths quickly but lacks a global view of the configuration space. IOS-MP iteratively alternates between global exploration and local optimization, sharing information between the two, to improve motion planning efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IOS-MP in scenarios of varying complexity and dimensionality.},

The mutual information between the measurement along the continuous path and the future verification variables defines the information reward. Two expressions for computing this mutual information are presented: the filter form extended from the state of the art and the smoother form inspired by the conditional independence structure. The key properties of the approach using the filter and smoother strategies are presented and compared. The smoother form is shown to be preferable because it provides better computational efficiency, facilitates easy integration with existing path synthesis tools, and, most importantly, enables correct quantification of the rate of information accumulation. A spatial interpolation technique is used to relate the motion of the sensor to the evolution of the measurement matrix, which leads to the formulation of the optimal path planning problem. A gradient-ascent steering law based on the concept of information potential field is also presented as a computationally efficient suboptimal strategy. A simplified weather forecasting example is used to compare several planning methodologies and to illustrate the potential performance benefits of using the proposed planning approach.},

The life-long learning behavior of the proposed perception model makes it suitable for long-term exploration missions. We validate the approach using simulated exploration experiments using aerial and underwater data, and demonstrate an implementation on the Aqua underwater robot in a variety of scenarios. We find that the proposed exploration paths that are biased towards locations with high topic perplexity, produce better terrain models with high discriminative power. Moreover, we show that the proposed algorithm implemented on Aqua robot is able to do tasks such as coral reef inspection, diver following, and sea floor exploration, without any prior training or preparation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate safe and efficient map-building strategies for a mobile robot with imperfect control and sensing. In the implementation, a robot equipped with a range sensor builds a polygonal map (layout) of a previously unknown indoor environment. The robot explores the environment and builds the map concurrently by patching together the local models acquired by the sensor into a global map. A well-studied and related problem is the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, where the goal is to integrate the information collected during navigation into the most accurate map possible. However, SLAM does not address the sensor-placement portion of the map-building task. That is, given the map built so far, where should the robot go next? This is the main question addressed in this paper. Concretely, an algorithm is proposed to guide the robot through a series of 'good' positions, where 'good' refers to the expected amount and quality of the information that will be revealed at each new location. This is similar to the next-best-view (NBV) problem studied in computer vision and graphics. However, in mobile robotics the problem is complicated by several issues, two of which are particularly crucial. One is to achieve safe navigation despite an incomplete knowledge of the environment and sensor limitations (e.g., in range and incidence). The other issue is the need to ensure sufficient overlap between each new local model and the current map, in order to allow registration of successive views under positioning uncertainties inherent to mobile robots. To address both issues in a coherent framework, in this paper we introduce the concept of a safe region, defined as the largest region that is guaranteed to be free of obstacles given the sensor readings made so far. The construction of a safe region takes sensor limitations into account. In this paper we also describe an NBV algorithm that uses the safe-region concept to select the next robot position at each step. The new position is chosen within the safe region in order to maximize the expected gain of information under the constraint that the local model at this new position must have a minimal overlap with the current global map. In the future, NBV and SLAM algorithms should reinforce each other. While a SLAM algorithm builds a map by making the best use of the available sensory data, an NBV algorithm, such as that proposed here, guides the navigation of the robot through positions selected to provide the best sensory inputs.},

Considering that weeds, at very early phenological stages, are similar spectrally and in appearance, three major components are relevant: spatial resolution, type of sensor and classification algorithm. Resampling is a technique to create a new version of an image with a different width and/or height in pixels, and it has been used in satellite imagery with different spatial and temporal resolutions. In this paper, $\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe efficiency of resampled-images (RS-images) created from real UAV-images $\backslash$r$\backslash$n(UAV-images; the UAVs were equipped with two types of sensors, i.e., visible and visible plus near-infrared spectra) captured at different altitudes is examined to test the quality of the RS-image output. The performance of the object-based-image-analysis (OBIA) implemented for the early weed mapping using different weed thresholds was also evaluated. Our results showed that resampling accurately extracted the spectral values from high spatial resolution UAV-images at an altitude of 30 m and the RS-image data at altitudes of 60 and 100 m, was able to provide accurate weed cover and herbicide application maps compared with UAV-images from real flights.},

abstract = {An information-theoretic path planning for exploration mission in unknown environment is proposed. Instead of using traditional grid-based occupancy maps, the Gaussian process (GP) is used to build an environmental map. The GP map performs inference directly on the collected sensor datasets which allows it to infer the probability of collision for any query point in continuous 3D space, removing the need for maintaining a full discrete map. This GP map is fused with the Rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) path planner to plan a safe path and acquire information about the unknown environments. Using mutual information as an information measure, the most informative path is chosen as the path for exploration. Simulation results show that GP map combined with RRT planner achieves exploration task successfully in unknown complex environment and present their potential implementation in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) missions.},

abstract = {Cameras are a natural fit for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) due to their low weight, low power consumption, and two-dimensional field of view. However, computationally-intensive algorithms are required to infer the 3D structure of the environment from 2D image data. This requirement is made more difficult with the MAV's limited payload which only allows for one CPU board. Hence, we have to design efficient algorithms for state estimation, mapping, planning, and exploration. We implement a set of algorithms on two different vision-based MAV systems such that these algorithms enable the MAVs to map and explore unknown environments. By using both self-built and off-the-shelf systems, we show that our algorithms can be used on different platforms. All algorithms necessary for autonomous mapping and exploration run on-board the MAV. Using a front-looking stereo camera as the main sensor, we maintain a tiled octree-based 3D occupancy map. The MAV uses this map for local navigation and frontier-based exploration. In addition, we use a wall-following algorithm as an alternative exploration algorithm in open areas where frontier-based exploration under-performs. During the exploration, data is transmitted to the ground station which runs large-scale visual SLAM. We estimate the MAV's state with inertial data from an IMU together with metric velocity measurements from a custom-built optical flow sensor and pose estimates from visual odometry. We verify our approaches with experimental results, which to the best of our knowledge, demonstrate our MAVs to be the first vision-based MAVs to autonomously explore both indoor and outdoor environments.},

The proposed approach allows for a dense map representation and incorporates the full state uncertainty into the planning process. The problem is formulated as a maximization problem with a budget constraint. Our approach is built on rapidly-exploring information gathering algorithms and benefits from advantages of sampling-based optimal motion planning algorithms. We propose two information functions and their variants for fast and online computations. We prove an information-theoretic convergence for the entire exploration and information gathering mission based on the least upper bound of the average map entropy. The convergence criterion gives rise to a natural automatic stopping criterion for information-driven motion control. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms using three scenarios: comparison of the proposed information functions and sensor configuration selection, robotic exploration in unknown environments, and a wireless signal strength monitoring task in a lake from a publicly available dataset collected using an autonomous surface vehicle.},

@article{Alterovitz2015,
abstract = {Recent years have seen significant technical progress on robot planning, enabling robots to compute actions and motions to accomplish challenging tasks involving driving, flying, walking, or manipulating objects. However, robots that have been commercially deployed in the real world typically have no or minimal planning capability. These robots are often manually programmed, tele-operated, or programmed to follow simple rules. Although these robots are highly successful in their respective niches, a lack of planning capabilities limits the range of tasks for which currently deployed robots can be used. In this article, we highlight key conclusions from a workshop sponsored by the National Science Foundation in October 2013 that summarize opportunities and key challenges in robot planning and include challenge problems identified in the workshop that can help guide future research towards making robot planning more deployable in the real world. Over 50 years have passed since the first industrial robot began service in a car assembly line and since development began on Shakey, the first robot capable of running the full cycle of autonomy, from sensing to planning to execution. Since that time, robotics has grown into a multi-billion dollar worldwide industry. In addition to industrial robotics companies such as ABB, KUKA, Yaskawa, and FANUC, in recent years a variety of companies such as Google, Intuitive Surgical, Amazon, SoftBank, iRobot, Apple, and Uber are increasingly investing in robotics in a variety of application areas, from warehouse management to medicine to home assistance to transportation. With advances in research, the next generation of robots have the potential to improve performance in established domains and create entirely new applications. Achieving the full potential of robotics will require improving the ability of robots to reason about how to accomplish a task, process sensor data in real time, utilize available resources effectively, cooperate with humans, and adapt to changes in the environment. An important building block of robots with these desirable capabilities is robot planning. A plan is ''a detailed proposal for doing or achieving something'' 1 , and planning in robotics typically corresponds to computing actions and motions for a robot to achieve a specified objective. McDermott in 1992 noted that planning requires ''reasoning about possible courses of execution'' 2 . Robot planning is often necessary for navigating through an environment, manipulating tools and objects, maintaining safety around humans, and gathering information necessary to complete a task 3 . Typically, a human user provides the robot with a high-level description of the task objectives and the robot planner computes actions and/or low-level motions for the robot to autonomously or semi-autonomously accomplish the task. Robots have to plan on multiple interacting levels, from low-level control to high-level task planning. The robot's planner is tightly integrated with a robot's other components; the robot planner utilizes information from the robot's sensing and perception systems, might be guided by the input of an operator, and outputs instructions to the control and actuation systems. Thus, progress in robot planning must go hand in hand with progress in computer vision, human-computer interfaces, and other areas. Robot planning is a critical component of enabling full robot autonomy, or it can facilitate shared autonomy in which a human and the robot share control. Robust and effective robot planning capabilities are needed to fully realize the potential of robots in a wide variety of applications, including self-driving vehicles, disaster response, minimally invasive surgery, and assistance for people in their homes and workplaces. Although recent years have seen substantial technical progress on robot planning, robots that have been commercially deployed on a large scale in the real world typically have no or minimal planning capability. These commercial robots are typically manually programmed for a specific task, tele-operated, or programmed to follow simple rules, as is the case for most manufacturing robots (such as automobile assembly manipulators), medical robots (such as Intuitive Surgical's da Vinci System), and special-purpose home assistance robots (such as the iRobot Roomba). These commercial robots are highly successful in their},

abstract = {In contrast to classic geometric motion planning, informative path planning (IPP) seeks a path for a robot to sense the world and gain information. In adaptive IPP, the robot chooses the next sensing location conditioned on all information acquired so far, and the robot's goal is to minimize the travel cost required for identifying a true hypothesis. Adaptive IPP is NP-hard, because the robot must trade-off information gain and travel cost optimally. In this paper we present Recursive Adaptive Identification (RAId), a new polynomial-time approximation algorithm for adaptive IPP. We prove a polylogarithmic approximation bound when the robot travels in a metric space. Furthermore, our experiments suggest that RAId is practical and provides good approximate solutions for two distinct robot planning tasks. Although RAId is designed primarily for noiseless observations, a simple extension allows it to handle some tasks with noisy observations.},

abstract = {Many robotic path planning applications, such as search and rescue, involve uncertain environments with complex dynamics that can be only partially observed. When selecting the best subset of ob- servation locations subject to constrained resources (such as limited time or battery capacity) it is an im- portant problem to trade off exploration (gathering information about the environment) and exploita- tion (using the current knowledge about the envi- ronment most effectively) for efficiently observing these environments. Even the nonadaptive setting, where paths are planned before observations are made, is NP-hard, and has been subject to much research. In this paper, we present a novel approach to adap- tive informative path planning that addresses this exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Our approach is nonmyopic, i.e. it plans ahead for possible obser- vations that can be made in the future. We quan- tify the benefit of exploration through the “adap- tivity gap” between an adaptive and a nonadaptive algorithm in terms of the uncertainty in the environ- ment. Exploiting the submodularity (a diminishing returns property) and locality properties of the ob- jective function, we develop an algorithm that per- forms provably near-optimally in settings where the adaptivity gap is small. In case of large gap, we use an objective function that simultaneously optimizes paths for exploration and exploitation. We also pro- vide an algorithm to extend any single robot algo- rithm for adaptive informative path planning to the multi robot setting while approximately preserving the theoretical guarantee of the single robot algo- rithm. We extensively evaluate our approach on a search and rescue domain and a scientific monitor- ing problem using a real robotic system},

Using a submodular objective function allows our algorithm to handle problems with diminishing returns, e.g. the case when taking a sample provides less utility when other nearby points have already been sampled. We give a formal description of this framework wherein an objective function that maps the path of the robot to the set of samples taken is defined. We also show how this framework can handle the case in which the robot takes samples along the edges of the graph. A proof of the approximation guarantee for the algorithm is given.

abstract = {Given an arc-weighted directed graph G = (V, A, l) and a pair of nodes s, t, we seek to find an s-t walk of length at most B that maximizes some given function f of the set of nodes visited by the walk. The simplest case is when we seek to maximize the number of nodes visited: this is called the orienteering problem. Our main result is a quasi-polynomial time algorithm that yields an O(log OPT) approximation for this problem when f is a given submodular set function. We then extend it to the case when a node v is counted as visited only if the walk reaches v in its time window [R(v), D(v)]. We apply the algorithm to obtain several new results. First, we obtain an O(log OPT) approximation for a generalization of the orienteering problem in which the profit for visiting each node may vary arbitrarily with time. This captures the time window problem considered earlier for which, even in undirected graphs, the best approximation ratio known [Bansal, N et al. (2004)] is O(log2 OPT). The second application is an O(log2 k) approximation for the k-TSP problem in directed graphs (satisfying asymmetric triangle inequality). This is the first non-trivial approximation algorithm for this problem. The third application is an O(log2 k) approximation (in quasi-poly time) for the group Steiner problem in undirected graphs where k is the number of groups. This improves earlier ratios (Garg, N et al.) by a logarithmic factor and almost matches the inapproximability threshold on trees (Halperin and Krauthgamer, 2003). This connection to group Steiner trees also enables us to prove that the problem we consider is hard to approximate to a ratio better than {\&}Omega;(log1-{\&}epsi; OPT), even in undirected graphs. Even though our algorithm runs in quasi-poly time, we believe that the implications for the approximability of several basic optimization problems are interesting.},

The key idea of Markov localization is to maintain a probability density over the space of all locations of a robot in its environment. Our approach represents this space metrically, using a ne-grained grid to approximate densities. It is able to globally localize the robot from scratch and to recover from localization failures. It is robust to approximate models of the environment (such as occupancy grid maps) and noisy sensors (such as ultrasound sensors). Our approach also includes a ltering technique which allows a mobile robot to reliably estimate its position even in densely populated environments in which crowds of people block the robot's sensors for extended periods of time. The method described here has been implemented and tested in several real-world applications of mobile robots, including the deployments of two mobile robots as interactive museum tour-guides.},

abstract = {We propose three sampling-based motion planning algorithms for generating informative mobile robot trajectories. The goal is to find a trajectory that maximizes an information quality metric (e.g. variance reduction, information gain, or mutual information) and also falls within a pre-specified budget constraint (e.g. fuel, energy, or time). Prior algorithms have employed combinatorial optimization techniques to solve these problems, but existing techniques are typically restricted to discrete domains and often scale poorly in the size of the problem. Our proposed rapidly exploring information gathering (RIG) algorithms combine ideas from sampling-based motion planning with branch and bound techniques to achieve efficient information gathering in continuous space with motion constraints. We provide analysis of the asymptotic optimality of our algorithms, and we present several conservative pruning strategies for modular, submodular, and time-varying information objectives. We demonstrate that our proposed techniques find optimal solutions more quickly than existing combinatorial solvers, and we provide a proof-of-concept field implementation on an autonomous surface vehicle performing a wireless signal strength monitoring task in a lake.},
