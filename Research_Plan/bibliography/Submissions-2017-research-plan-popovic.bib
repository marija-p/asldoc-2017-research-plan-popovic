abstract = {In this article, we propose a sampling-based motion planning algorithm equipped with an information-theoretic convergence criterion for incremental informative motion planning. The proposed approach allows for a dense map representation and incorporates the full state uncertainty into the planning process. The problem is formulated as a maximization problem with a budget constraint. Our approach is built on rapidly-exploring information gathering algorithms and benefits from advantages of sampling-based optimal motion planning algorithms. We propose two information functions and their variants for fast and online computations. We prove an information-theoretic convergence for the entire exploration and information gathering mission based on the least upper bound of the average map entropy. The convergence criterion gives rise to a natural automatic stopping criterion for information-driven motion control. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms using three scenarios: comparison of the proposed information functions and sensor configuration selection, robotic exploration in unknown environments, and a wireless signal strength monitoring task in a lake from a publicly available dataset collected using an autonomous surface vehicle.},

abstract = {Many robotic path planning applications, such as search and rescue, involve uncertain environments with complex dynamics that can be only partially observed. When selecting the best subset of ob- servation locations subject to constrained resources (such as limited time or battery capacity) it is an im- portant problem to trade off exploration (gathering information about the environment) and exploita- tion (using the current knowledge about the envi- ronment most effectively) for efficiently observing these environments. Even the nonadaptive setting, where paths are planned before observations are made, is NP-hard, and has been subject to much research. In this paper, we present a novel approach to adap- tive informative path planning that addresses this exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Our approach is nonmyopic, i.e. it plans ahead for possible obser- vations that can be made in the future. We quan- tify the benefit of exploration through the “adap- tivity gap” between an adaptive and a nonadaptive algorithm in terms of the uncertainty in the environ- ment. Exploiting the submodularity (a diminishing returns property) and locality properties of the ob- jective function, we develop an algorithm that per- forms provably near-optimally in settings where the adaptivity gap is small. In case of large gap, we use an objective function that simultaneously optimizes paths for exploration and exploitation. We also pro- vide an algorithm to extend any single robot algo- rithm for adaptive informative path planning to the multi robot setting while approximately preserving the theoretical guarantee of the single robot algo- rithm. We extensively evaluate our approach on a search and rescue domain and a scientific monitor- ing problem using a real robotic system},

This monitoring, when applied to agricultural environments, can help the identification of diseases and produce accurate information about contaminated areas. However the methodology is flexible enough to apply to other classification problems. This paper presents a route planning method for improving knowledge on visited areas and the minimization of uncertainties about the classification of diseased trees. Binary Logistic Regression and Gaussian Process were used for the detection of pathologies and map interpolation, respectively. Bayesian optimization was applied for the planning of an informative trajectory, which resulted in a maximized search for affected areas in an initially unknown environment.},

@article{Hitz2015,
abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots are increasingly employed to take measurements for environ- mental monitoring, but planning informative, measurement-rich paths through large three- dimensional (3D) environments is still challenging. The problem of planning such paths is known as the informative path planning (IPP) problem, and has been shown to be non- deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard. Existing algorithms focus on providing guaran- tees on suboptimal solutions, but do not scale well to large problem instances. In this paper, we introduce a novel IPP algorithm that uses an evolutionary strategy (ES) technique to optimize a parametrized path in continuous space, which is subject to various constraints regarding path budgets and motion capabilities of an autonomous mobile robot. Moreover, we introduce a replanning scheme to adapt the planned paths according to information gained from measurements taken in situ during a data collection mission. When compared to opti- mal paths on discrete graphs, our method provides competitive results at significantly lower computation times and memory requirements. Our results show that planning in continuous space can provide solutions which outperform the optimum on a discrete graph. The proposed replanning scheme enables to build models with up to 25{\{}{\%}{\}} lower uncertainty within an (initially unknown) areas of interest. After presenting theoretical results, we tailored the proposed algorithms for data collection using an autonomous surface vessel (ASV) within the context of an ecological study, during which the method was validated through three field deployments on Lake Zurich, Switzerland. Spatiotemporal variations are shown over a period of three months and an area of 350 m × 350 m × 13 m. Whereas our theoretical solution can be applied to multiple applications, our field results specifically highlight the effectiveness of our planner for monitoring toxic cyanobacteria populations in a pre-alpine lake, and for identifying hot-spots within the cyanobacterial distribution.},

@article{Binney2013,
abstract = {We introduce a graph-based informative path planning algorithm for a mobile robot which explicitly handles time. The objective function must be submodular in the samples taken by the robot, and the samples obtained are allowed to depend on the time at which the robot visits each location. Using a submodular objective function allows our algorithm to handle problems with diminishing returns, e.g. the case when taking a sample provides less utility when other nearby points have already been sampled. We give a formal description of this framework wherein an objective function that maps the path of the robot to the set of samples taken is defined. We also show how this framework can handle the case in which the robot takes samples along the edges of the graph. A proof of the approximation guarantee for the algorithm is given. Finally, quantitative results are shown for three problems: one simple example with a known Gaussian process model, one simulated example for an underwater robot planning problem using data from a well-known ocean modeling system, and one field experiment using an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) measuring wireless signal strength on a lake.},

@article{Hollinger2014,
abstract = {We propose three sampling-based motion planning algorithms for generating informative mobile robot trajectories. The goal is to find a trajectory that maximizes an information quality metric (e.g. variance reduction, information gain, or mutual information) and also falls within a pre-specified budget constraint (e.g. fuel, energy, or time). Prior algorithms have employed combinatorial optimization techniques to solve these problems, but existing techniques are typically restricted to discrete domains and often scale poorly in the size of the problem. Our proposed rapidly exploring information gathering (RIG) algorithms combine ideas from sampling-based motion planning with branch and bound techniques to achieve efficient information gathering in continuous space with motion constraints. We provide analysis of the asymptotic optimality of our algorithms, and we present several conservative pruning strategies for modular, submodular, and time-varying information objectives. We demonstrate that our proposed techniques find optimal solutions more quickly than existing combinatorial solvers, and we provide a proof-of-concept field implementation on an autonomous surface vehicle performing a wireless signal strength monitoring task in a lake.},

@article{Krause2008,
abstract = {When monitoring spatial phenomena, which can often be modeled as Gaussian processes (GPs), choosing sensor locations is a fundamental task. There are several common strategies to address this task, for example, geometry or disk models, placing sensors at the points of highest entropy (vari-ance) in the GP model, and A-, D-, or E-optimal design. In this paper, we tackle the combinatorial optimization problem of maximizing the mutual information between the chosen locations and the locations which are not selected. We prove that the problem of finding the configuration that max-imizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1 − 1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of mutual information. We also show how submodularity can be used to obtain online bounds, and design branch and bound search procedures. We then extend our algorithm to exploit lazy evaluations and local structure in the GP, yielding significant speedups. We also extend our approach to find placements which are robust against node failures and uncertainties in the model. These extensions are again associated with rigorous theoretical approximation guarantees, exploiting the submodu-larity of the objective function. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach towards optimizing mutual information in a very extensive empirical study on two real-world data sets.},

@article{Cardina1997,
abstract = {Seed dispersal, interacting with environmental disturbance and management across heterogeneous landscapes, results in irregular weed spatial distributions. Describing, predicting, and managing weed populations requires an understanding of how weeds are distributed spatially and the consequences of this distribution for population processes. Semivariograms and kriged maps of weed populations in several fields have helped describe spatial structure, but few generalizations can be drawn except that populations are aggregated at one or more scales. Limited information is available on the effect of weed arrangement, pattern, or field location on weed population processes. Because weeds are neither regular nor uniform in distribution, mean density alone is of limited value in estimating yield loss or describing population dynamics over a whole field. Sampling strategies that account for spatial distribution can increase sampling efficiency. Further research should focus on understanding processes that cause changes in spatial distributions over time to help predict rates of invasion and potential extent of colonization.},

abstract = {Increasingly, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) are changing the way that scientists and practitioners collect environmental data. Current UASs, however, are largely relegated to collecting data while flying remotely, far away in the air. This article examines two case studies where micro-UASs fly in immediate proximity to the environment, enabling them to collect physical samples and capture sensor data that cannot be obtained at a distance. The first case study presents an aerial water sampler that flies to remote locations and dips a pump into the water to collect samples for lab analysis. The second case study examines a UAS that flies within a meter of crops to accurately measure their height. Each requires different sensors and methods specifically tailored to operating and interacting near the environment. This article evaluates the performance of these systems and also presents preliminary validation that they collect datasets that are compatible with those gathered by existing approaches. Futhermore, it distills some common underlying design and operating principles shared by UASs aimed at working close to the environment. Finally, this article concludes that in spite of numerous pending challenges, UASs that directly interact with the environment will transform the way environmental data is collected.},

A common approach in machine learning to model spatial dynamics is to use the nonparametric Bayesian framework known as Gaussian Processes (GPs) (c.f., [1]) which are fully specified by a mean and a covariance function. However, defining suitable covariance functions that are able to appropriately model complex space-time dependencies in the environment is a challenging task. In this paper, we develop a generic approach for constructing several classes of covariance functions for spatio-temporal GP modeling. The GP models are then extended to perform efficient path planning in continuous space while maximizing the information gain. Extensive empirical evaluation for the different classes of covariance functions using real world sensing datasets is discussed, including experiments on a tethered robotic system - Networked Info Mechanical System (NIMS).},

To address this problem we devise a layered Bayesian Optimisation approach that uses two Gaussian Processes, one to model the phenomenon and the other to model the quality of selected paths. By using different acquisition functions over both models we tackle the exploration-exploitation trade off in a principled manner. Our method optimises sampling over continuous paths and allows us to find trajectories that maximise the reward over the path.

Our algorithms exploit submodularity, an intuitive notion of diminishing returns common tomany sensing problems: themore sensors we have already deployed, the less we learn by placing another sensor. In addition to identifying the most informative sensing locations, our algorithms can handle more challenging settings, where sensors need to be able to reliably communicate over lossy links, where mobile robots are used for collecting data, or where solutions need to be robust against adversaries and sensor failures.

@article{Girdhar2015,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to modeling curiosity in a mobile robot, which is useful for monitoring and adaptive data collection tasks, especially in the context of long term autonomous missions where pre-programmed missions are likely to have limited utility. We use a realtime topic modeling technique to build a semantic perception model of the environment, using which, we plan a path through the locations in the world with high semantic information content. The life-long learning behavior of the proposed perception model makes it suitable for long-term exploration missions. We validate the approach using simulated exploration experiments using aerial and underwater data, and demonstrate an implementation on the Aqua underwater robot in a variety of scenarios. We find that the proposed exploration paths that are biased towards locations with high topic perplexity, produce better terrain models with high discriminative power. Moreover, we show that the proposed algorithm implemented on Aqua robot is able to do tasks such as coral reef inspection, diver following, and sea floor exploration, without any prior training or preparation.},
