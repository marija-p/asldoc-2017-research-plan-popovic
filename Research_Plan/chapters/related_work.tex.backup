To discuss:

\subsection{UAVs for environmental monitoring}
\begin{itemize}
 \item General overview of applications
 \item Focus on agriculture
\end{itemize}

\unsure{How generic should the following sub-sections be?}

\subsection{Informative path planning}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Motivate IPP development, define IPP
 \item 3 ingredients for model-aided path planning
   \begin{itemize}
     \item Environmental model: GPs, occupancy grids
     \item Objective function: entropy-based
     \item Planning algorithm: continuous vs. discrete, adaptive vs. non-adaptive
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Adaptive sampling}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Spatio-temporal phenomena, dynamic processes
 \item What has to be done to account for environmental model changing over time?
\end{itemize}

\unsure{Should I decide where to do further research}
\subsection{Operational issues?}
Localization, control issues, systems.

\subsection{Cooperative monitoring?}
Consider problems with multiple agents.
