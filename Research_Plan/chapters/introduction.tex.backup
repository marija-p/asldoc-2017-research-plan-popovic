\begin{itemize}
 
 \item (Scientific) importance of environmental monitoring spatio-temporal phenomena 
\unsure{How application-specific? e.g. monitoring fields vs monitoring in general} \unsure{Should I focus on 
one application for the plan?}
 \item Advantages of using autonomous systems
 \item Current research gaps ($\rightarrow$ connect to related work sections)
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Planning paths for efficient data-gathering given constraints (vehicle mobility, time, fuel)
  \item Adaptive sampling
  \item Operational issues, cooperative planning?
 \end{itemize}
 \item The proposed research aims at providing (IPP) solutions for environmental monitoring using aerial 
robots \unsure{One or many?}
 \item Section \ref{S:related_work} of this research plan overviews related work in the field. The proposed 
approach, and its scientific contributions, are detailed in Section \ref{S:proposed_approach}. Finally, 
Section \ref{S:time_schedule} outlines the planned time schedule of the thesis.
